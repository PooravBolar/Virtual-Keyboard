# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Virtual Keyboard

This project creates a virtual keyboard that can be controlled using hand gestures. Using computer vision and hand tracking, you can press virtual keyboard buttons by hovering your finger over the keys and tapping in mid-air. Ideal for touchless interaction, it’s perfect for creating an intuitive user experience!
